A5E Concentrator is part of a suite of modules that aim to provide basic automation for the A5E system. This module adds the concentration condition and automates the application of the effect on the use of a spell that requires concentration. Taking damage prompts the GM or the player to roll for a concentration check and removes the effect if the save isn't successful.

**Note: For the concentrator automation to work the damage dealt needs to be done either via the "does it hit?" module or through the token bar.**
